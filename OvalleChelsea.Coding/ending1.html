    <h1>Ending One</h1>
    <p>
    Limping towards the forest as fast as you can, you find a hole big enough to hid you in a tree. Just when you got your body inside you hear footstep and a chainsaw run by you. Waiting a 20 more minutes, you crawl out and limp towards the road just in time to see a car driving down. Stopping the car you ask the driving to take you to the closest town, escaping.
